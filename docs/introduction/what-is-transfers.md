# What is Transfers?

**Transfers** is a cloud based SaaS application that aims to modernize the student transfer process. 

## Why should I use Transfers?

Managing transfer applications can be a pain, especially if your district has limited resources and/or no documented processes.

**Transfers** helps by:

- Implementing a standard process for parents and districts to follow
- Automating data entry into your SIS (Student Information System)
- Eliminating paper forms and loose emails
- Providing analytics to help districts make decisions

## Return on Investment

### Increased ADA

By providing an easy way for parents to submit applications, you are more likey to secure new enrollments and increase your district's ADA (Average Daily Attendance).

### Standard Processes

When someone leaves a district (e.g. resign, retire, etc...), they take everything with them (e.g. knowledge, processes, routines, etc...). Hiring takes months and training takes even longer, especially when processes weren't documented. Instead of reinventing the wheel with every new hire, **Transfers** defines the process for everyone to follow.

### Analytics 

Making data driven decisions is difficult when you don't have the right tools. **Transfers** makes this possible by providing analytics  to help district make better informed decisions when it comes to budgeting, programs, staffing, etc...
