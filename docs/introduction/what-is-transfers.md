# What is Transfers?

Transfers is [SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-saas/) application that aims to modernize the student transfer process.

## Why?

As a district, managing transfer applications can be tough. Limited resources, time constraints, and no documented processes can make a simple process very complex.

Transfers helps by:

- Creating the process for  districts and submitters to follow
- Automating data entry into your student information system (SIS)
- Helping increase average daily attendance (ADA)
- Eliminating paper forms and loose emails
- Providing document transfers (e.g. out-of-district permit, transcripts, discipline reports, birth certificate, etc...)
