# What is Transfers?

Transfers is [SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-saas/) application that aims to modernize the student transfer process.

## Why?

Managing transfer applications can be tough, especially if your district has limited resources and/or no documented processes.

Transfers helps by:

- Creating the process for parents and districts to follow
- Automating data entry into your student information system (SIS)
- Helping increase average daily attendance (ADA)
- Eliminating paper forms and loose emails
- Providing important document transfers (e.g. out-of-district permit, birth certificate, etc...)
