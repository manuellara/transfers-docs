# What is Transfers?

**Transfers** is a cloud based SaaS application that aims to modernize the student transfer process. It allows parents to submit applications easily and districts the ability to process them efficiently. Results are then published to a dashboard to help districts make decisions. **Transfers** is built with the best technologies available to make the student transfer process as frictionless as possible.

## Why should I use Transfers?

Managing transfer applications can be a pain, especially if your district has limited resources and/or no documented processes.

**Transfers** helps by:

- Implementing a standard process for parents and districts to follow
- Automating data entry into your SIS (Student Information System)
- Eliminating paper forms and loose emails
- Providing an analytics dashboard to help your district make decisions (e.g. budgeting, programs, staffing, etc...)

## Return on Investment

Introducing a new tool can be challenging, but the value **Transfers** provides is well worth the growing pains. 

### Increased ADA

By providing an easy way for parents to submit applications, you are more likey to secure new enrollments and increase your district's ADA (Average Daily Attendance).

### Standard Processes

When someone leaves a district (e.g. resign, retire, etc...), they take everything with them (e.g. knowledge, processes, routines, etc...). Hiring takes months and training takes even longer, especially when processes weren't documented. Instead of reinventing the wheel with every new hire, **Transfers** defines the process for everyone to follow.

### Analytics 

Collecting and maintaining application data is hard enough on its own - telling a story with it is another realm of difficulty. Data engineering is definitely out of reach for most districts, however, **Transfers** offers this as a courtesy.
